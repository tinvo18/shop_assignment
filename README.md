# shop_assignment
If you want to test this application please use the postman (Shop.postman_collection.json) what I include in TinVo_shop.zip file.
I use H2 database engine so, and apply flyway to run script so you donâ€™t need to configure anything, just only run application and verify.
I also include a sketches: Shop_assignment_sketches.jpg to visualize my idea.
We have 2 cases to verify: 
1. Test discount in range time -> created data in range 16/01 -> 31/01
2. Test discount when apply the voucher.
